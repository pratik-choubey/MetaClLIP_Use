# MetaClLIP
MetaCLIP by Meta AI. is a new approach to language-image pre-training that focuses on data curation. It takes a raw data pool and metadata derived from CLIP's concepts to produce a balanced subset of data based on the metadata distribution.

You can use the raw model for linking images with text in a shared embedding space. This enables things like zero-shot image classification, text-based image retrieval, image-based text retrieval, etc.
